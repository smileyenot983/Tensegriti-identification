# Tensegriti identication
 Matlab package for visual identification of tensegriti structure(tensegriti stand). It takes data in csv format and out
 
 ## Main scripts:
 
2 main scripts:
 ```sh
loader_modified.m
visual_helper_place_rods_modified.m
```

## How to work with it:
1. Record csv file(with optitrack) with single rigid body(in script it's called weight, but it's possible to change name) and n arbitrarily placed markers(for now there are 20 markers).

2. Load csv file and save all the data in binary file('.m' extension) by running 'loader_modified.m' and providing it location of csv and location of binary file. In case there are not 20 markers, change value for n_markers variable. After running this script matlab will generate table with evolution of position for markers and body with respect to time.

3. For visual identification of markers run 'visual_helper__place_rods_modified.m'. This script will plot initial positions of all markers, and generate positions of vertices of cube in the center(according to position and orientation of end effector). In case variable visualize = True, it will also draw rods and springs, that connect all the markers(but before running this it is required to find correspondence between real positions of markers and the ones generated by optitrack).
